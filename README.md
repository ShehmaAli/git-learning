# üöÄ Git Commands ‚Äì Notes & Cheat Sheet

A handy reference for all the **Git commit-related commands**. Ideal for beginners and experienced developers working with Git regularly.

## üîß Git Setup (One-Time)

Before committing, make sure to set your Git identity:
now these are the basic things I've learned till now

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"


git add <filename>        # Stage a specific file
git add .                 # Stage all files in the current directory (new + modified)
git add -A                # Stage all changes (including deletions)

git commit -m "Your commit message"      # Commit with a message
git commit -a -m "Quick commit"          # Automatically stage modified files and commit

git commit --amend                      # Modify last commit (interactive)
git commit --amend -m "New message"     # Change last commit message directly

git status         # Show status of working directory and staging area
git diff           # View unstaged changes
git diff --staged  # View staged changes ready to commit

git log                            # Full commit log
git log --oneline                  # One-line summaries of commits
git log --graph                    # Visualize commit tree
git log -p                         # Show changes introduced by each commit
git log --stat                     # Show stats (files changed, insertions/deletions)

git push                           # Push to default remote (usually origin)
git push origin main               # Push to a specific branch

git reset --soft HEAD~1            # Undo last commit, keep staged changes
git reset --mixed HEAD~1           # Undo last commit, keep changes in working directory
git reset --hard HEAD~1            # Undo last commit, discard changes

```

Git push
# üì¶ Git Push Cheat Sheet

`git push` is used to upload local repository content (commits, branches, tags) to a remote repository like GitHub.

---

## üöÄ Basic Syntax

```bash
git push [remote] [branch]
```
## Git push commandsüéÄ

```bash
git push                          #Pushes to the remote branch set as upstream.                                   |
git push origin main              #Push `main` branch to the remote `origin`.                                     |
git push -u origin main           #Push `main` branch and set it as upstream for future pushes.                   |
git push origin dev               #Push `dev` branch to `origin`.                                                 |
git push --all                    #Push all branches to remote.                                                   |
git push origin --tags            #Push all local tags to the remote.                                             |
git push origin :branch-name      #Delete the remote branch named `branch-name`.                                  |
git push --force or git push -f   #Force push the current branch (overwrite remote history).                      |
git push origin HEAD              #Push the current local HEAD (current branch) to the remote with the same name. |
```
# üîÑ Git Pull Cheat Sheet

`git pull` is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately merge it with your local branch.

It‚Äôs effectively the same as:
```bash
git fetch
git merge
```

but git pull is more effective with greater and more handling

## basic format ‚¨áÔ∏è
```bash
git pull [remote] [branch]
```

## ‚ú® git pull commands ‚ú®

```bash
Command	                                     Description
git pull	                  #Pulls from the tracked upstream branch and merges it.
git pull origin main	          #Pulls from the main branch of the origin remote.
git pull --rebase	          #Fetches and rebases instead of merging. Keeps history linear.
git pull origin main --rebase	  #Pulls from main and rebases changes.
git pull --all	                  #Fetch and merge all branches from all remotes.
git pull --no-commit	          #Merge but don‚Äôt automatically commit the result.
git pull --ff-only	          #Only fast-forward if possible; otherwise, abort.
git pull --no-rebase	          #Ensures regular merge (disables rebasing).
```

## üå± What is a Branch?

A **branch** in Git is a lightweight movable pointer to a commit. It's used to isolate features, fixes, or experiments.

---

## üìÑ View Branches

```bash
git branch                         # List local branches
git branch -r                      # List remote branches
git branch -a                      # List all branches (local + remote)

```

## new branches

```bash
git branch <branch-name>          # Create a new branch (no switch)
git checkout -b <branch-name>     # Create and switch to new branch
git switch -c <branch-name>       # Alternative: create and switch

```

## switching between branches
```bash
git checkout <branch-name>        # Switch to another branch
git switch <branch-name>          # Modern alternative to checkout
```

## deleting branches
```bash
git branch -d <branch-name>       # Delete a local branch (safe ‚Äì checks for merge)
git branch -D <branch-name>       # Force delete a local branch
git push origin --delete <name>   # Delete a remote branch
```

## switching from local to remote or remote to local
```bash
git push origin <branch-name>     # Push a local branch to remote


git fetch                         # Fetch all remote updates
git checkout <branch-name>        # Switch to the remote branch (after fetch)

# or
git checkout -b <local-name> origin/<remote-name>

```
## Renaming the branch 

``` bash
git branch -m new-name             # Rename current branch
git branch -m old-name new-name    # Rename a specific branch
```

## to see the details of the branch
```bash
git show-branch                   # Show branches and their commits
git log --oneline --graph --all   # Show commit tree visually
```



till now this is it more will be added later
