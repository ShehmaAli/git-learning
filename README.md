now these are the basic things I've learned till now

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"


git add <filename>        # Stage a specific file
git add .                 # Stage all files in the current directory (new + modified)
git add -A                # Stage all changes (including deletions)

git commit -m "Your commit message"      # Commit with a message
git commit -a -m "Quick commit"          # Automatically stage modified files and commit

git commit --amend                      # Modify last commit (interactive)
git commit --amend -m "New message"     # Change last commit message directly

git status         # Show status of working directory and staging area
git diff           # View unstaged changes
git diff --staged  # View staged changes ready to commit

git log                            # Full commit log
git log --oneline                  # One-line summaries of commits
git log --graph                    # Visualize commit tree
git log -p                         # Show changes introduced by each commit
git log --stat                     # Show stats (files changed, insertions/deletions)

git push                           # Push to default remote (usually origin)
git push origin main               # Push to a specific branch

git reset --soft HEAD~1            # Undo last commit, keep staged changes
git reset --mixed HEAD~1           # Undo last commit, keep changes in working directory
git reset --hard HEAD~1            # Undo last commit, discard changes

```

Git push
# ðŸ“¦ Git Push Cheat Sheet

`git push` is used to upload local repository content (commits, branches, tags) to a remote repository like GitHub.

---

## ðŸš€ Basic Syntax

```bash
git push [remote] [branch]
git push                          #Pushes to the remote branch set as upstream.                                   |
git push origin main              #Push `main` branch to the remote `origin`.                                     |
git push -u origin main           #Push `main` branch and set it as upstream for future pushes.                   |
git push origin dev               #Push `dev` branch to `origin`.                                                 |
git push --all                    #Push all branches to remote.                                                   |
git push origin --tags            #Push all local tags to the remote.                                             |
git push origin :branch-name      #Delete the remote branch named `branch-name`.                                  |
git push --force or git push -f   #Force push the current branch (overwrite remote history).                      |
git push origin HEAD              #Push the current local HEAD (current branch) to the remote with the same name. |
```
